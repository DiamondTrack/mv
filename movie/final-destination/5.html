                While on a business retreat, Sam has a premonition that he, his co-workers, boss, and several other people will die in a horrific bridge collapse. When his premonition ends, he tries to make everyone get off the bus. Only some of his co-workers, along with his boss, leave. Shortly after, the bridge collapses. Everyone thinks that they are safe until the survivors start dying. It is now up to Sam to try to find a way to prevent anyone else from dying before it is too late.
