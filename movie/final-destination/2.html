                Whilst heading onto the highway, Kimberly Corman has a vision of a huge car accident. Bringing the traffic to a halt, Kimberly is horrified when the accident actually happens. Kimberly links the occurrence with a similar event that occurred one year ago, on the same date that she had her premonition: the Flight 180 disaster. After speaking with Clear Rivers, the only remaining survivor of the Flight 180 disaster, Kimberly discovers that Death's pattern has been disturbed, meaning everyone who was originally supposed to die will now be killed in separate freak accidents. Kimberly and the remaining survivors must work with Clear to try and stop Death from repeating its process.
